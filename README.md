## INTRODUCTION

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of employee data from ABC Corporation, aiming to identify key factors influencing job satisfaction and employee retention. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data transformation, A/B testing, visualizations, and the development of a MySQL database and ETL process.
  
## FILES

Files required for project review:

*    HR RAW EMPLOYEES.csv: contains information about ABC Corporation employees.
*    HR RAW DATA CLEAN.csv: CSV file created by us after a thorough cleaning of the data from the initial CSV.
*    BBDD_abc_corp_employees.sql: DB created by us from the CSV we generated after data cleansing.




## REQUIREMENTS

*Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:*

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn
6. mysql connector
7. scipy stats, chi2_contingency


If you do not have these libraries, you can install them using *pip install* 

## THE PROCESS 
### Built with

*Technologies used in the project:*

*   Operating system: Windows 10 Home
*   Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
*   Programming Language: Python
*   Libraries specified above
*   Version Control: Git, GitHub
*   Dependency Management: Pip
*   MySQL Workbench


### First phase: deep data exploration

#### Importing libraries and loading data:

*Importing and use of pandas to load CSV files into DataFrames.*

#### General exploration 

*   General deep review and analysis of data using Pandas functions to obtain information about the structure of the data and basic statistics.
*   Initial exploration of the data to identify potential problems (null values, duplicate values, outliers, missing data, etc.).
*   DataFrame joining

### Second phase: data transformation

*   Verification of data consistency and correctness.
*   Removing unnecesary columns
*   Homogenization of titles and values.
*   Treatment of negative numbers, outliers, null data and duplicated values.

### Third phase: visualization

Study of six real-world questions about the data and their representation through graphs.

### Fourth phase: DataBase

Statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether job satisfaction levels have a significant effect on employee turnover. This involved dividing employees into two groups based on satisfaction (e.g., high vs. low), comparing their turnover rates using A/B testing methods, and analyzing the effect size to assess the magnitude of the relationship.

### Fifth phase: DataBase

Creation of a DB (with clean DF) in MySQL Workbench, editing tables and their corresponding relations/restrictions. Lastly, creation of the DB diagram.

### Sixth phase: ETL

Data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL): -automation of the data insertion into the DB and the information transformation process to ensure that information is updated and inserted in a consistent manner.
